While the gap has narrowed substantially for full-year full-time workers in most provinces, it has widened for other employment types, such as part-time workers. 
Notably, the Labor Force Survey (2022) indicates that women participate in part-time work at higher rates than men.
This factor is crucial in understanding the nuances of the observed pay disparity.",
